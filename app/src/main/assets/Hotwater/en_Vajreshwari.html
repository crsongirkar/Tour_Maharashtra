<p>
The town here was originally called Vadvali, though now the Goddess Vajreshwari has had her name adopted for the town. The town Vajreshwari, on the banks of river Tunga, which lies in the Thane district, Maharashtra. Vajreshwari is at the foot of Mandakini Mountain, which was formed out of a volcanic eruption and it is this proximity that accounts for the many hot springs in this region. There exist several hot springs here. It is reported that there are around 21 hot water springs, just within a 5 kilometer radius of the temple.
</p>

<p>
The Tansa River flows through here, rich with its hot waters. the most well known ones being located here and at the nearby villages of Akloli, Ganeshpuri, Nimboli and Satavalli. The temperature of the water in the springs ranges from 43°C to 49°C. The main reason for hot springs is because of their nearness to the former volcano in the region accounts for their creation.
</p>

<p>
This place Very crowded during monsoon and winters and springs averagely maintained but sure worth a visit if you have never seen hot springs any time before.
